    <h1>Rohan Shah</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Rohan Shah and I am excited to work at the intersection of robotics, energy, and areospace.
        Ever since I was a kid, I have been inspired by science fiction and NASA to dream of the stars. I believe that the future is bright, but only if we build it.  
    I love to sail and dream of sailing the Mediterranian. I also love to hike, and spent a summer hiking in the Whites of New Hampshire and the Cascades/Olympics in Seattle. My favorite peak was Mt. St Helens. Looking into the crater was a strange and awe inspiring site.</p>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>Stoke Space Avionics Intern - Summer 2025</h3>
        <p> At Stoke I was tasked with designing a HIL Simulator of
             an Electronic Safe and Arm Device for FTS to verify our FTS system on the ground,
            and to pave the way for a flight in house ESAD. 
             The ESAD is responsible for arming, safing, and triggering the Bulk Destruct Charge which is responsible for terminating thrust in the rocket in the case of an anomly to safegaurd the public.
            This requires a high voltage, high current pulse (1000V 1000A) to be delivered with a rise time of less than 100ns. This was the core challenge of the project, requiring careful part selection
             and layout to create an low inductance firing path, while standing off low-voltage electronics. The board also contained discrete logic to trigger the firing, safing and arming circuit. These logic systems were built with simple logic gates to reduce power consumption and remove and firmware.
            The project required that I get up to speed with FAA/Range requirements in the form of RCC-19 along with the accompanying tailoring documents. By the end of the internship I had succesfully brought up a Rev0 board spin verifying the digital logic systems and succesffully creating the high voltage pulse. I am currently contracting with Stoke this Fall to design another revision of this board to bring it to flight standards.</p>

    <h4>Current Course Load: Mixed Analog Digital VLSI, Probablistic Modeling, Thermodynamics, Self and World</h4>
    <h3>Previous Course Work</h3>
    <p>These are a few of the courses I have taken in the last 2 years that I have learned a lot from and that I have enjoyed.</p>
    <h3>Introduction to Micro Electronic Circuits</h3>
    <h4>Skills: Circuit Analysis, LTspice, Analog Design/Analysis</h4>
    <p>In this class I learned the basics of micro electronics with a
     focus on analog design and hand analysis. The course covered BJT's
     and MOSFETS in all regions of operations. The class was lab based,
     with weekly assignments that involved using hand calculations to
     predict the behavior of a circuit, building and testing the circuit,
     and then extending the circuit in simulation. For my final project 
     I attempted to construct a True Random Number Generator using a 
     bistable element circuit. Unfortunately I was unable to generate
     random behavior due to poorly matched components and a poorly 
     controlled testing setup. My final writeup is linked here:

    <h3>Computer Architecture</h3>
    <h4>Skills: Verilog, Automated Verification, FPGA, Digital design</h4>
    <p>Computer Architecture walked from logic gates to designing a RISC-IV processor.
        During the class we used a ICE-0 FPGA Dev Board to complete a series of 
        mini-projects covering the basics of implementing state machines,
        fetches from memory, and counters. For the final mini-project we were
        tasked with designing a RISC-IV processor>. I designed a processor with a 
        Harvard Architecture. Here is a picture of the block diagram I used to
        develop my processor. I developed automatic test benches in System Verilog
        to verify the function of the processor. For my final project I developed
        a memory mapped soft UART core for the processor and tested it in simulation.

    <h3>Advanced Systems Programming In Rust</h3>
    <h4>Skills: Rust, Firmware Development</h4>
    <p>In this class I learned Rust and some of it's fun quirks (generics, the borrow checker, unsafe).
        I really enjoyed learning the language, and now use RUST as my main Programming
        language for larger projects. The class also allowed me to try out Rust firmware, specifically
        for the RP2040. For my final project I partnered with another student to create
        a rudimentery HIL testing setup. We used a RP2040 to act as a flight Computer
        with another RP2040 acting as a HIL tester, mocking accelerometer data for the flight computer.
        The HIL unit communicated with a laptop running a physics simulation to create fake data.
        I worked on the firmware for both the HIL unit and the mock Flight Computer, while my partner developed
        the Physics Engine. Here is a link to the github page for the project.
